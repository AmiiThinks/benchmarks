# Instructions to run the program
1. Install dependencies 
    conda create --name cc2 python=3.8 
    conda activate cc2 
    conda install pybind11 # pip3 install pybind11 doesn't work
    pip3 install -r requirements.txt (for CPU)
    pip3 install -r requirements_gpu.txt (for GPU) # jaxlib depends on available CUDA and CUDNN version (https://github.com/google/jax#installation)
                                                   # This is is for CUDNN version: 8.9, CUDA version: 11.6

2. Create Chinese Checker board environment
    cd build
    cmake ..
    make # make sure the paths to pybind.h, numpy.h are correct

    # the c++ wrapper (.so) file is in build, move it to python2/wrappers

3. Run Self-play benchmark (benchmark 1)
    bash benchmark_1.sh

4. Run training benchmark (benchmark 2)
    bash benchmark_2.sh
